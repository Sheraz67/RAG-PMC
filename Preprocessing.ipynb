Abstract COVID‐19 demonstrated the complex manner in which discourses from risk science are manipulated to legitimize government action. We use Foucault's theory of Governmentality to explore how a risk science discourse shaped national and local government action during COVID‐19. We theorize how national government policymakers and local government risk managers were objectified by (and subjectified themselves to) risk science models, results, and discourses. From this theoretical position we analyze a dataset, including observations of risk science discourse and 22 qualitative interviews, to understand the challenges that national government policymakers, risk scientists, and local government risk managers faced during COVID‐19. Findings from our Foucauldian discourse analysis show how, through power and knowledge, competing discourses emerge in a situation that was disturbed by uncertainty—which created disturbed senders (policymakers and risk scientists) and disturbed receivers (risk managers) of risk science. First, we explore the interaction between risk science and policymakers, including how the disturbed context enabled policymakers to select discourse from risk science to justify their policies. This showed government's sociopolitical leveraging of scientific power and knowledge by positioning itself as being submissive to “follow the science. ” Second, we discuss how risk managers (1) were objectified by the discourse from policymakers that required them to be obedient to risk science, and paradoxically (2) used the disturbed context to justify resisting government objectification through their human agency to subjectify themselves and take action. Using these concepts, we explore the foundation of risk science influence in COVID‐19.

Risk Analysis , 44 , 2889 – 2905. 10. 1111/risa. 14213 37660243 1 INTRODUCTION Before the COVID‐19 pandemic, risk science created knowledge of pandemic risk (e. g. , Fischhoff et al. , 2018 ; Wein & Atkinson, 2009 ) which informed policies/plans to manage a pandemic. In COVID‐19, risk was the combined potential for undesirable consequences of the virus and the uncertainties in the measures taken to control it (Aven, 2022 ). Risk science was a term used to explain a broad range of risk assessments that were undertaken to provide information on risk characteristics and informed a basis on which to select solutions and precautionary measures to manage that virus (Aven & Thekdi, 2021 ). Risk scientists did not take the decisions, but their findings informed advice that helped policymakers to understand and measure how risks changed (ibid). To inform decisions, risk scientists developed risk models as decision support tools (Aven, 2015 ) and local government risk managers acted according to their plans and the knowledge created from analyzing emerging risks (Vekaria et al. , 2021 ) and response options (Siegrist et al. , 2021 ). But, despite claims of the COVID‐19 response being science‐led, Aven and Bouder ( 2020 ) suggested it was informed by risk science that was reinterpreted by government to create a political discourse. To explore their suggestion, we analyze the political leveraging of knowledge from risk science to justify government action during COVID‐19. How risk science influences action is foundational (Aven, 2019 ) but has not been explored before using Foucault's concept of Governmentality and theory of discourse (Foucault, 1980 , 1982 , 1984 , 1994 , 2010 ). We select Foucault because of his renowned work on Governmentality (Althaus, 2005 ; Raffnsøe et al. , 2019 ), which is the art of governing through exploiting mechanisms to regulate and control populations, and encourage self‐governance, through the power and knowledge of discourse (Turner, 1997 : xiii). Foucault ( 1972 ) described discourse as “the interplay of the rules that make possible the appearance of objects during a given period of time” (p. 33) and as “tactical elements or blocks operating in the field of force relations” (Foucault, 1984 , p. 101–p. 102) where “points of resistance will open up” (ibid, p. 95). As Mingers and Wilcocks ( 2004 ) suggested, Foucault's views discourse as an argumentative force for emancipation which involves a process of “unfreezing” people minds to bring about change. For Foucault, discourse is a way of thinking and communicating that is expressed through social interaction and includes talking/writing, and structuring/presenting knowledge as a way to gain or maintain power (Fairclough, 1992 ). Foucault explains how risk is a socially constructed discourse (Alaszewski, 2021 ) which governments use to control citizens (Ahrens & Ferry, 2021 ). In Governmentality, Foucault explains that scientific discourse is an “indirect mechanism of state power” (Latour, 1987 , p. 219) which supports governing by “action at a distance” (Latour, 1987 ) in providing tactics to exercise political power.\n",

Introduction: Widespread mask use is an important intervention for control of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. However, data on the factors affecting mask use are lacking. In this observational study, we evaluated the proportion of and factors influencing face mask use and related hygiene practices. Methods: We observed randomly selected members from the public in 367 venues across Singapore, and recorded the proportion of individuals with full compliance with mask use and mask hygiene (hand hygiene before and after touching the mask or face). Logistic regression analyses were used to determine variables associated with mask and hand hygiene compliance. Results: We made 3,821 observations — 2,149 (56. 2%) females, 3,569 (93. 4%) adults (≥21 years), 212 (5. 5%) children (6–20 years) and 40 (1. 0%) children (2–5 years). The overall full compliance rate (correct mask use), poor compliance rate (incorrect mask use) and absent mask use were 84. 5%, 12. 9% and 2. 6%, respectively. The factors — male gender, fabric mask usage and crowded indoor venues — were associated with lower mask compliance. Face or mask touching behaviour was observed in 10. 7% and 13. 7% of individuals observed, respectively. Only one individual performed hand hygiene before and after touching the mask. Conclusion: The rate of mask compliance was high, probably due to legislation mandating mask usage. However, specific factors and crowded indoor venues associated with lower mask compliance were identified. We also noted an issue with the absence of hand hygiene before and after face or mask touching. These issues may benefit from targeted public health messaging.

INTRODUCTION The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has expanded exponentially across the globe in less than a year and has impacted healthcare systems, the global economy, societal norms and our daily lives irrevocably. One visible impact is that the use of face masks has been thrust into central focus, becoming a polarising issue that has been divisive, even along political lines. [ 1 ] There is accumulating data that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads via airborne or aerosol transmission. [ 2 3 ] Consequently, most advisory bodies, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have formally recommended widespread usage of surgical or face masks in the community to limit transmission of COVID-19 via droplets and respiratory aerosols. [ 4 5 ] As SARS-CoV-2 transmission by asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals has been reported, a universal face mask policy has an important role to play in a multi-pronged approach for outbreak control. [ 6 7 ] Modelling studies have demonstrated that widespread or universal use of face masks in the community has a significant impact on curtailing transmission, with a consequent reduction in mortality rates. [ 8 9 ] Several epidemiologic investigations have also reported the use of face masks being associated with preventing transmission in situations whereby large outbreaks may have otherwise occurred. [ 10 11 12 ] Even if face mask use does not eliminate infection risk, it may lower the viral inoculum that an individual is exposed to, resulting in a clinically milder infection. [ 13 14 ] However, beyond simply ensuring high rates of community mask use, it is equally important to ensure that proper face mask usage and hygiene is followed. Improper use of face masks (e. g. not adequately covering mouth and nose, and not observing hand hygiene) may compromise their protective effect. Community observational studies have evaluated the general public’s proficiency in N95 respirator usage[ 15 ]; however, there is scant data on compliance to proper face mask usage, which is crucial data required especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this community observational study, we evaluated the proportion of face mask usage, the extent of correct face mask usage and face mask-related hygiene practices among the general public in Singapore. METHODS Study design This observational study was conducted from 29 July 2020 to 18 August 2020.\n",

Introduction: Localised swelling at sites of filler injections has been reported in the Moderna mRNA-1273 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine trial. Methods: We conducted a review of the existing data and literature on the potential pathophysiology for this adverse event and its potential management. Results: Data from the Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine Phase 3 trial and one case series were available. Three out of 30,400 subjects developed possible filler reaction in the Moderna trial. Two other cases were reported after emergency use authorisation. Reactions occurred at a mean of 1. 4 days post-vaccination. Fillers were injected at a mean of 14. 1 months before vaccination. Areas involved included lips, infraorbital areas and tear troughs. Treatment included observation, corticosteroids, antihistamine, hyaluronidase and 5-fluorouracil. Conclusion: Rare, self-limiting adverse reactions to dermal fillers have been reported following COVID-19 vaccination. Clinicians should be aware of this clinical phenomenon and its management, as vaccination is carried out globally. Dermal fillers COVID-19 local swelling vaccination Nil INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing global pandemic caused by the causative pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). [ 1 ] A Coordinated Global Research Roadmap was published by the World Health Organization (WHO) to guide research efforts and vaccine development. [ 2 ] Several COVID-19 vaccines have been authorised for administration to humans. The United States Federal Drug Administration (FDA) has given emergency use authorisation (EUA) for Pfizer-BioNTech (Pfizer) (New York, NY, USA and Mainz, Germany) and Moderna (Cambridge, MA, USA) vaccines. [ 3 4 ] The release of data submitted by Moderna to the FDA on 30 November 2020 from an ongoing Phase 3 randomised, double-blinded and placebo-controlled trial of its mRNA-1273 vaccine in approximately 30,400 study participants revealed a serious adverse event of localised facial swelling in two patients and a medically significant event of lip angioedema in one patient who had previous dermal filler injections in the treatment group. [ 4 ] While both the Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines are mRNA-based vaccines, Pfizer did not report adverse events related to dermal fillers in the data submitted to the FDA. [ 5 ] In light of this new development, we conducted a review of the existing data and literature on the potential pathophysiology for this adverse event and the potential management options. METHODS A systematic literature review was performed for information and articles on COVID-19- and COVID-19 vaccine-related dermal filler swelling/oedema and facial swelling/oedema; and vaccine-, viral- and drug-related dermal filler swelling/oedema, oedema and facial swelling/oedema. Our search strategy was as follows: first, we conducted a search within the FDA, Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) websites for information on vaccine trial data; then, we searched the databases, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science and Scopus, for relevant literature. We did not include cutaneous reactions that were not explicitly associated with dermal filler injections. RESULTS Table 1 summarises the cases of dermal filler reactions from COVID-19 vaccination. The information was gleaned from Phase 3 trial data on the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine,[ 5 ] as well as a case series that reported two other patients who developed filler reactions post-EUA. [ 6 ] Table 1 Characteristics of patients with dermal filler reactions after COVID-19 vaccination.

[ 5 ] Two patients reported swelling on the face, without further mention of specific subsites of the face. In the remaining patient, the swelling was described as lip angioedema without mention of whether the upper, lower or both lips were involved. However, the document reported the resolution of facial swelling in all three subjects. After EUA was given by the FDA, there were two other reported cases of localised facial swelling at sites of previous hyaluronic acid (HA) filler injection after COVID-19 vaccination. One had received the Moderna mRNA vaccine, and the other had received the Pfizer mRNA vaccine. [ 6 ] Based on the information provided, filler reactions occurred at a mean of 1. 4 days post-vaccination. The fillers were injected at a mean duration of 14. 1 months before vaccination.\n",

Introduction: Our aim was to analyse how the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affects a hip fracture bundled care protocol. We hypothesised that key performance indicators, but not short-term outcomes, may be adversely affected. Methods: Patients admitted under a hip fracture bundled care protocol were divided into two arms: ‘COVID’ group included patients admitted in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic and ‘PRE-COVID’ group included patients admitted in 2019. We retrospectively analysed time to admission, time to surgery, length of stay, discharge disposition, as well as rates of 30-day revision surgery, 30-day readmission and inpatient mortality. Results: There were 307 patients in the PRE-COVID group and 350 patients in the COVID group. There was no significant difference in terms of gender, age and type of hip fracture. The COVID group had a higher proportion of American Society of Anesthesiologists classification III and IV patients (61. 4% vs. 50. 2% in the PRE-COVID group; P = 0. 004). In the COVID group, similar proportion of patients were admitted to the ward within 4 h, but the mean time to surgery was longer (71. 8 ± 73. 0 h vs. 60. 4 ± 72. 8 h in the PRE-COVID group; P = 0. 046) and few patients underwent operations within 48 h (41. 7% vs. 60. 3% in the PRE-COVID group; P < 0. 001). Mean postoperative length of stay, discharge disposition, as well as rates of inpatient mortality, 30-day revision surgery and 30-day readmission were similar. Conclusion: The volume of hip fractures during the COVID-19 pandemic remained unchanged, although patients admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to be more deconditioned. Nevertheless, having robust protocols and staff familiar with hip fracture treatment can preserve short-term outcomes for this group of patients, even with strict isolation measures in place during a pandemic. Bundled care COVID-19 hip fracture patient outcomes Nil INTRODUCTION The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic crippled many healthcare systems worldwide. In Singapore, an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases led to a government-imposed social lockdown. Strict measures were implemented — only essential services were allowed to continue and students were shifted to home-based learning. Relaxation of such restrictions ensued once the spread of the virus was contained, but the restrictions on social activities were enforced for most of 2020 [ Table 1 ]. [ 1 ] Table 1 Timeline of events affecting Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. [ 1 ] Date Events 23 January First confirmed case of COVID-19 – Chinese man from Wuhan, China 7 February The Ministry of Health raises the DORSCON level to orange and enforced stricter measures to control the pandemic 21 March Singapore reports its first two COVID-19 deaths 7 April to 1 June ‘Circuit breaker’ measures kick in – enhanced social distancing and isolation, closing down of workplaces, schools and most shops; only people within the same household are allowed to interact 2 June Phase 1 of reopening – businesses and activities are progressively allowed to resume 19 June Phase 2 of reopening – dining in restaurants is allowed and each household is allowed to receive up to five visitors 3 December Phase 3 of reopening – dining in groups of eight is allowed COVID-19: coronavirus disease 2019, DORSCON: Disease Outbreak Response System Condition Existing studies show that the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the volume of osteoporotic hip fractures may vary between countries,[ 2 3 4 ] and measures have to be taken to ensure that the management of these patients, who are usually the elderly with multiple comorbidities and at a greater risk of COVID-19 complications, is not compromised. Current literature shows that early surgical intervention for hip fractures minimises perioperative risk and improves clinical outcomes. [ 5 6 7 ] Modelling after the recommendations in the ‘Blue Book’ by the British Orthopaedic Associate and British Geriatric Society,[ 8 ] our institution implemented a hip fracture bundled care protocol in 2017 involving a multidisciplinary approach to expedite the process from presentation at the emergency department (ED) to surgery. It also includes collaboration with physiotherapists, occupational therapists and community rehabilitation providers to ensure a smooth transition to stepdown care. Key performance indicators (KPIs) used to evaluate this protocol include ward admission from ED presentation within 4 h, time to surgery from ED within 48 h and postoperative length of stay within 9 days. Our orthopaedic department had to divert resources to the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Personnel segregation was implemented, manpower was diverted away to manage COVID-19 patients, and non-essential ambulatory visits and surgeries were postponed. [ 9 ] Screening protocols for high-risk elderly individuals with comorbidities were implemented to reduce nosocomial spread. Additional precautions were taken to postpone surgeries until the risk of nosocomial COVID-19 infection was minimised. [ 10 ] To further reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission, our institution introduced a set of screening criteria to identify patients at risk of COVID-19 infection.\n",

Bumble bees are important pollinators for a great diversity of wild and cultivated plants, and in many parts of the world certain species have been found to be in decline, gone locally extinct, or even globally extinct. A large number of symbionts live on, in, or with these social bees. We give an overview of what is known about bumble bee ecto-symbionts and parasitoids. We provide information on assessment of risks posed by select bumble bee symbionts and methods for their detection, quantification, and control. In addition, we assess honey bee hive products such as pollen and wax that are used in commercial bumble bee production, and highlight key risks and knowledge gaps. Knowledge of these potential threats to native pollinators is important and they need to be managed in the context of national and international commercial trade in bumble bees to prevent pest introduction and pathogen spillover that can threaten native bees. Bombus bumble bee symbionts parasites pathogens Introduction Bumble bees ( Bombus spp. ) are widely distributed primarily in temperate and alpine regions of the world, are exceptionally good pollinators of many cultivated and wild plant species, and are now the focus of a well-developed and growing commercial market involving both national and international trade ( Goulson 2009 ). As is true for many species, they have a large number of symbionts, which bridge the range from innocuous to lethal in their effects on their hosts. We have reviewed elsewhere the diversity of endosymbionts, including viruses, bacteria, protozoans, fungi, and nematodes, but excluding tracheal mites ( Figueroa et al. 2023 ), and consider here the smaller number of ectosymbionts, parasitoids, and the commerce in pollen and wax that could impact both wild and domesticated colonies of bumble bees ( e. g. , B. terrestris in Europe, B. impatiens in North America and B. huntii in western Canada). 1. Ectosymbionts Acarines There are at least 91 mites associated with bumble bees ( Klimov et al. 2016 ; Klimov et al. 2017 ), yet most that are found on the host’s exterior are considered to be harmless nest commensals ( Table S1 ). Mites are most often found on queens, with one study finding mites on 74% of queens, with lower frequency on males (37%) and workers (27%) ( Haas et al. 2019 ). The mites found externally on spring queens are not known to survive in the commercial rearing environment ( Velthuis & van Doorn 2006 ). Scutacarus acarorum , an inquiline of bumble bee nests known to feed primarily on fungus ( Jagersbacher-Baumann & Ebermann 2013 ) has incorrectly been described as an occasional parasite of bumble bee larvae ( Jagersbacher-Baumann 2015 ). Other bumble bee-associated mites that are thought to have non-parasitic life histories include Kunzia americana, K. affinis, Parasitellus (formerly Parasitus ) spp. , Proctolaelaps longisetosus, and P. bombophilus ( Delfinado & Baker 1976 ; Eickwort 1990 ; Goldblatt & Fell 1987 ; Richards & Richards 1976 ). Most of these mites are thought to be scavengers or fungivores within nests rather than associated with individual bees, although some are predatory and may benefit the bumble bees by consuming nest pests ( Eickwort 1990 ). Others have an uncertain status in nests. Pneumolaelaps species seem to be obligate specialists in bumble bee nests, and although they have been observed feeding on injured bees, they might be best classified as kleptoparasites that consume only the freshly collected pollen intended for larvae ( Hunter & Husband 1973 ; Royce & Krantz 1989 ). While many mite species are expected to be phoretic or commensalistic ( Houck 1993 ), the exact incidence across different life stages and different species of bumble bees is not well documented. On the whole, the ecologies of mites are understudied, and completely unknown for some bumble bee associates, like the Cerophagus spp.\n",

Bumble bees ( Bombus spp. ) are important pollinators for both wild and agriculturally managed plants. We give an overview of what is known about the diverse community of internal potentially deleterious bumble bee symbionts, including viruses, bacteria, protozoans, fungi, and nematodes, as well as methods for their detection, quantification, and control. We also provide information on assessment of risk for select bumble bee symbionts and highlight key knowledge gaps. This information is crucial for ongoing efforts to establish parasite- conscious programs for future commerce in bumble bees for crop pollination, and to mitigate the problems with pathogen spillover to wild populations. Bombus bumble bee symbionts parasites pathogens Introduction Bumble bees ( Bombus species) are widespread globally, but most prevalent and diverse at high altitudes and high latitudes, where they can constitute a large proportion of the pollinator fauna. There is reason for concern about their status, as declines have been reported around the world ( Arbetman et al. 2017 ; Graves et al. 2020 ; Soroye et al. 2020 ; Van Dooren 2019 ), and a North American species has been listed as endangered and hasn’t been seen since 2006 ( https://biologicaldiversity. org/w/news/press-releases/elusive-pacific-northwest-bumblebee-listed-as-endangered-2021-08-23/ ; accessed 18 January 2023). Bumble bees are important pollinators for both wild and cultivated plants, and there is now a thriving trade in commercial colonies, shipped to many parts of the world, for pollination of crops such as tomatoes, blueberries, and raspberries, both in greenhouses and open fields ( Velthuis & van Doorn 2006 ). The loosely regulated trade of commercial bumble bees has led to the introduction of a variety of endoparasites, with possible spillover to conspecifics and other species in the wild bumble bee community, or to native species when the commercial species are non-native ( Colla et al. 2006 ; Graystock et al. 2013b ). We are still discovering the extent and frequency of parasite spread to wild communities through commerce, and the consequences of these introductions for native bees. As a prelude to potential regulation, such as a “clean stock” mandate that bees be certified as parasite-free before being shipped ( Strange et al. 2023 ), it is important to know the diversity of known bumble bee endosymbionts, their impacts on hosts (when known), and potential mechanisms for preventing future introductions. Here we review the literature and describe the diversity, pathology, and detection methods for bumble bee viruses, bacteria, protozoans, fungi, and nematodes, as well as associated knowledge gaps. 1) Symbionts potentially deleterious to bumble bees In this section, we address some of the most important, most commonly encountered, and best-known potentially deleterious internal symbionts of bumble bees (i. e. , endosymbionts), particularly those that are of interest in captive rearing environments. This is far from a complete list (See supplementary Symbiont List in Appendix I ) but interested readers who wish to learn about some of the more obscure organisms associated with bumble bees are encouraged to seek the works on parasitism ( Beaurepaire et al. 2020 ; de Miranda et al. 2013 ; Macfarlane et al. 1995 ; Schmid-Hempel 1999 ) and bumble bee natural history ( Alford 1975 ; Goulson 2010 ). Additionally, we use the term “parasite” broadly to refer to organisms of all taxa, including viruses, that sustain themselves at the expense of their hosts and have the potential to cause harm to their hosts, a definition which, for our purposes, also encompasses the term “pathogen”. Here we focus on known bumble bee endosymbionts; a review of known bumble bee ectosymbionts can be found in Evans et al. (2023). Recommendations for implementing a clean stock program to detect and prevent the spread of parasites of concern in commercial rearing facilities that pose a threat to wild bees can be found in Strange et al. (2023).\n",

Bat-borne pathogens are a threat to global health and in recent history have had major impacts on human morbidity and mortality. Examples include diseases such as rabies, Nipah virus encephalitis, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Climate change may exacerbate the emergence of bat-borne pathogens by affecting the ecology of bats in tropical ecosystems. Here, we report the impacts of climate change on the distributional ecology of the common vampire bat Desmodus rotundus across the last century. Our retrospective analysis revealed a positive relationship between changes in climate and the northern expansion of the distribution of D. rotundus in North America. Furthermore, we also found a reduction in the standard deviation of temperatures at D. rotundus capture locations during the last century, expressed as more consistent, less-seasonal climate in recent years. These results elucidate an association between D. rotundus range expansion and a continental-level rise in rabies virus spill-over transmission from D. rotundus to cattle in the last 50 years of the 120-year study period. This correlative study, based on field observations, offers empirical evidence supporting previous statistical and mathematical simulation-based studies reporting a likely increase of bat-borne diseases in response to climate change. We conclude that the D. rotundus rabies system exemplifies the consequences of climate change augmentation at the wildlife–livestock–human interface, demonstrating how global change acts upon these complex and interconnected systems to drive increased disease emergence. bats climate change emerging infectious disease rabies spillover Introduction Human disturbance of ecosystems can modify wildlife–pathogens dynamics, which can result in the emergence of infectious diseases ( Morens et al. 2004 ). Interactions among humans, livestock, and wildlife populations associated with ecosystem disturbance can facilitate pathogen spillover (i. e. cross-species pathogen transmission) ( Plowright et al. 2017 ). A series of factors have been proposed as facilitators of pathogen spillover from wildlife to humans; specifically land use change ( Gibb et al. 2020 ). Nevertheless, one area of scientific uncertainty and concern is the potential impact of global climate change on wildlife pathogen spillover ( Carlson et al. 2022 ). Climate change can have comprehensive impacts across human, animal, and ecosystem health, potentially acting as a key driver of host–pathogen interaction frequency ( Arthur et al. 2017 , Cohen et al. 2019 , Carlson et al. 2022 ). Many climate-change studies on spillover risk, however, have been based on future climate change simulations, rather than retrospective empirical data ( Carlson et al. 2022 ). Additionally, little climate-change research has been conducted on directly transmitted diseases of wildlife origin. Infectious agents such as Hendra virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Nipah virus have emerged to cause pathogenic outbreaks in humans via spillover transmission from bats to intermediate animal hosts ( Letko et al. 2020 ). The mechanisms of spillover transmission, successful establishment in new species, and how posterior spread continues on to cause epidemics are vital components of the broader disease emergence continuum. As such, understanding the extent to which climate change influences bat ecology is of critical importance for the understanding and prediction of emerging bat-borne diseases. Rabies virus (RABV) belongs to the genus Lyssavirus (Rhabdoviridae), which causes rabies disease. Bat-borne RABV has been reported to only occur in the Western Hemisphere ( Velasco-Villa et al. 2017b ). Rabies is one of the oldest directly transmitted infectious diseases to affect humans in recorded history and the most lethal of all zoonotic diseases, with fatality rates at nearly 100% ( Meske et al. 2021 ). Approximately 50 000 recorded human deaths due to rabies are reported annually despite vaccination efforts, with many of these deaths occurring in at-risk populations ( Hampson et al. 2015 ). Rabies also has precipitous impacts to livestock, domesticated pets, and wildlife ( Meske et al. 2021 ). Bat-borne RABV spillover from wildlife to domesticated species is frequent and widespread in the Americas ( Pan American Health Organization 2022 ). The common vampire bat Desmodus rotundus , one of three sanguivorous species in the Phyllostomidae family, is considered to be the main wildlife species responsible for transmitting RABV to other domestic animals and humans in Latin America ( Meske et al. 2021 ). Desmodus rotundus -transmitted RABV is a well understood and documented directly transmitted pathogen of wildlife origin in tropical and sub-tropical regions in Latin America, where RABV is commonly transmitted from D. rotundus to cattle ( Pan American Health Organization 2022 ).\n",

Several outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported on warships at sea, where transmission is facilitated by living and working in close quarters. Core components of infection control measures such as social distancing, patient isolation and quarantine of exposed persons are extremely difficult to implement. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 has facilitated epidemiological investigations of outbreaks, impacting on outbreak management in real time by identifying transmission patterns, clusters of infection and guiding control measures. We suggest such a capability could mitigate against the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in maritime settings. Methods We set out to establish SARS-CoV-2 WGS using miniaturised nanopore sequencing technology aboard the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ARGUS while at sea. Objectives included designing a simplified protocol requiring minimal reagents and processing steps, the use of miniaturised equipment compatible for use in limited space, and a streamlined and standalone data analysis capability to allow rapid in situ data acquisition and interpretation. Results Eleven clinical samples with blinded SARS-CoV-2 status were tested at sea. Following viral RNA extraction and ARTIC sequencing library preparation, reverse transcription and ARTIC PCR-tiling were performed. Samples were subsequently barcoded and sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore MinION Mk1B. An offline version of the MinKNOW software was used followed by CLC Genomics Workbench for downstream analysis for variant identification and phylogenetic tree construction. All samples were correctly classified, and relatedness identified. Conclusions It is feasible to establish a small footprint sequencing capability to conduct SARS-CoV-2 WGS in a military maritime environment at sea with limited access to reach-back support. This proof-of-concept study has highlighted the potential of deploying such technology in the future to military environments, both maritime and land-based, to provide meaningful clinical data to aid outbreak investigations. COVID-19 molecular diagnostics molecular biology Research and Clinical Innovation, Defence Medical Directorate, Birmingham, UK RCI/MR3WGS/01 WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC It is known that SARS-CoV-2 causes outbreaks on military maritime platforms which can be difficult to control. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a valuable tool which can impact outbreak management by identifying transmission patterns, infection clusters and guiding control measures. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS This proof-of-concept study describes establishing SARS-CoV-2 WGS using miniaturised nanopore sequencing technology with standalone data processing aboard a ship at sea for the first time. HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY This approach has the potential to be used in multiple deployed military settings, not only for SARS-CoV-2, but also in targeting other pathogens, providing a valuable additional diagnostic capability. Introduction The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in several challenges for military populations, with outbreaks reported in numerous settings ranging from training establishments to operational deployments. 1 3 Within these settings, environmental constraints may facilitate viral transmission and impair effective infection prevention and control measures. This has been especially true for maritime platforms, which is consistent with previous experience of respiratory viruses (eg, influenza) and enteric pathogens (eg, norovirus) which can spread rapidly. 4 5 Military populations at sea may be sizeable, with many thousands of sailors deployed at any one time, presenting further challenges. 6 In addition, naval commands have had to balance operational capability with the management of a highly contagious and morbid respiratory virus while individuals work in proximity and in confined spaces. 7 Several outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 have occurred on warships at sea, where the core components of infection control measures, such as social distancing, isolation of sick patients and quarantine of exposed persons, are extremely difficult to implement. 68 10 SARS-CoV-2 can spread quickly among a ship’s crew with transmission readily facilitated by close-quarters conditions and by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infected crew members. 6 The index case(s) of SARS-CoV-2 aboard a ship may originate from initial embarkation or following acquisition by crew members during overseas port visits. 9 The latter raises the potential for individuals being exposed to novel viral variants, including vaccine escape mutants, posing a greater risk to personnel and the subsequent mission.\n",

Graphical abstract Highlights • Present three critical obstacles of current treatment against H. pylori infection. • Summarize recent advances in stimulus-responsive biomaterials against H. pylori. • Responses to endo -stimuli circumvent physiological barrier faced by antibiotics. • Responses to exo -stimuli improve spatiotemporal accuracy of H. pylori therapy. • Research on biodegradable and target-responsive materials will be a future focus. Background Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ), the only bacterium classified as a type I (definite) carcinogen, is strongly associated with the development of gastric inflammation and adenocarcinoma. It infects the stomach of approximately half of the global population, equivalent to nearly 4. 4 billion people. However, due to physiological barriers in the stomach, microbial barriers and increased antibiotic resistance, the therapeutic efficiency of standard antibiotic therapy is limited and cannot meet the clinical needs in some areas. Combining stimulus-responsive biomaterials with certain stimuli is an emerging antibacterial strategy. Stimulus-responsive biomaterials can respond to chemical, biological or physical cues in the environment with corresponding changes in their own properties and functions, highlighting a more intelligent, targeting and efficient aspect for H. pylori therapy. Aim of Review: This review describes the critical obstacles in the current treatment of H. pylori , summarizes the recent advances in stimulus-responsive biomaterials against H. pylori by elucidating their working mechanisms and antibacterial performances under different types of stimuli (pH, enzymes, light, magnetic and ultrasound irradiations), and attempts to analyze the future prospects of such smart biomaterial for H. pylori eradication. Key Scientific Concepts of Review: Any characteristic property or change in the biomilieu at the H. pylori infected site (endogenous stimuli) or specific iatrogenic conditions in vitro (exogenous stimuli) can act as cues to activate or potentiate the antibacterial activity of responsive biomaterials. The responsiveness of these materials to endogenous stimuli enhances antimicrobial targeting, and makes physiological barriers that would otherwise hinder conventional H. pylori therapies a key factor in facilitating antibacterial effects. The responsiveness to exogenous stimuli greatly prolongs the action time of antimicrobial materials and pinpoints the site of infection, thereby reducing toxic side effects. These findings pave the way for the development of more precise and effective anti- H. pylori treatment. Keywords Helicobacter pylori Antibacterial Stimulus-responsive pH-responsive Targeting Introduction Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) is one of the most recalcitrant pathogens, that has coexisted with human for approximately 60,000 years [1]. It is an obligate microaerobic Gram-negative bacterium and currently infects nearly 60. 3 % of the global population [2]. In countries with inferior socioeconomic conditions, the prevalence of H. pylori can even reach more than 80 % of the population [2]. Everyone infected with H. pylori , although mostly asymptomatic, develops superficial coexisting gastritis and persists a dynamic as well as biologically costly prolonged equilibrium coupling the bacterium and its host [3]. In this long-term relationship, the initial inflammation response of gastric mucosa can evolve toward chronic non-atrophic, active or atrophic gastritis followed by gastric ulcers or even intestinal metaplasia, leading to dysplasia and adenocarcinoma [4]. As a matter of fact, H. pylori is the only bacterium classified as a type I (definite) carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) since 1994 [5]. H. pylori infection accounts for 89 % of non-cardia gastric cancer and 6. 2 % of all cancers worldwide [6]. The eradication of H. pylori plays an essential role in suppressing gastric inflammation, preventing its progression to preneoplastic lesions, and reducing the incidence of gastric cancer and other extragastric pathologies. Because H. pylori mainly colonizes the space between the gastric mucous layer and gastric epithelial lining cells of human, the characteristic physiology of stomach including gastric acid, mucosal barrier and digestive enzymes becomes physiological barriers against H. pylori treatment. For the past few years, triple or quadruple therapies based on the combination of antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were recommended as the first-line anti- H. pylori therapy by the Maastricht consensus report [7]. The main antibiotics involve clarithromycin, amoxicillin, metronidazole and tetracycline, which are responsible for killing or clearing H. pylori [8]. The PPIs such as rabeprazole, omeprazole and ranitidine, act by inhibiting gastric acid secretion to strengthen the action of antibiotics [9]. Such conventional standard regimes have been considered effective for decades. However, due to the increasing antibiotic resistance, the eradication rates of H. pylori with conventional regimes have declined significantly in recent years, which may not be able to meet the clinical needs of H. pylori treatment in some areas [10]. Therefore, alternative therapies such as high-dose PPI-amoxicillin dual therapy, vonoprazan-based triple therapy and probiotics supplemented therapy came into being and have achieved some positive results [10] , [11].\n",

Keywords Myelomeningocele Spinal dysraphism Well woman care Women with disabilities Transition to adult care General gynecology Abbreviations SB spina bifida HIV human immunodeficiency virus HPV human papillomavirus hrHPV high-risk human papillomavirus USPSTF United States Preventative Services Task Force EHR electronic healthcare record IDD intellectual and developmental disabilities 1 Introduction Women with spina bifida (SB) have unique and often under-met reproductive health care needs. 1 Known gynecological concerns include pelvic organ prolapse, precocious puberty, uterine/vaginal anatomical anomalies, and high-risk pregnancies. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 Clinicians must also consider that women with SB may have unique needs regarding sexual function and contraception options, adaptive considerations for menstrual self-management, and nuanced questions about sexuality and reproduction. 1 , 5 , 6 Moreover, individuals with disabilities are at higher risk for sexual dysfunction due to both medical and psychological etiologies and sexual abuse. 7 However, women with SB and those with other disabilities often face barriers to adequate reproductive care such as difficulty accessing accommodating facilities for exams, inadequate reproductive education, provider biases, lack of provider knowledge about their reproductive care needs, and lack of education and preparation for pregnancy and healthy intimate relationships. 5 , 8 , 9 , 10 Further study of reproductive healthcare disparities, specifically deficits in meeting national guideline based preventive measures can better inform the development of interventions aimed at closing these gaps in reproductive care. The Women’s Health section in the Spina Bifida Association’s 2018 Guidelines for the Care of People with SB offers guidance on reproductive health management, but acknowledges evidence limitations in reproductive education, sexual function, and menses/menopause care. 11 For women with SB aged 18 and above, these guidelines encourage the following routine preventive gynecological care including age-appropriate cervical cancer screening and mammograms, sexual health care and education. In addition, the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) gives age-specific general reproductive health screenings for all women. The 2018 recommendations pertinent to women aged 18–40 include: screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) beginning at age 15 and completing the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine series starting at age 11 per the Center for Disease Control guidelines. For women aged 12–29 years, routine cervical cancer screening is recommended every 3 years with cervical cytology alone. For women aged 30–65 years, screening is recommended every 3 years with cervical cytology alone, every 5 years for high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing alone, or every 5 years with hrHPV testing in combination with cytology (cotesting). 12 These SB-specific and general guidelines offer recommendations that should be routinely implemented in clinics caring for adolescent and adult women with SB. This cross-sectional study sought to add to the limited body of knowledge about gynecological care needs of young women with SB transferring to adult care by (1) describing demographic and clinical characteristics, gynecological concerns, and exam findings in young adult women with SB establishing gynecological care and (2) evaluating the frequency at which they had received USPSTF recommended reproductive health screenings. 13 This study will inform future research areas and further development of SB gynecological care and transition to adult care guidelines. 2 Methods The STROBE checklist was used to guide this cross-sectional study. 14 After receiving approval from the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Review Board, investigators reviewed electronic healthcare record (EHR) records of women with SB who had established gynecological care in a single clinic between June 1, 2018 and May 31, 2020. 15 2. 1 Clinic setting The Baylor Transition Medicine Clinic is a primary care medical home clinic for adults who have intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) including SB. 15 The clinic not only “transitions” patients graduating from the pediatric hospital system to the adult system, but then continues as the primary care medical home for these patients for the entire lifespan. The clinic also accepts adults with IDD who prefer to see a primary care provider experienced in IDD care. Women with IDD from this primary clinic are referred to a gynecologist imbedded in the clinic for well woman care (e. g. reproductive health screenings, education, and exams) and gynecological health management (menses management, reproductive health planning, and sexual function questions). The gynecologist has a specific interest in caring for women with IDD.\n",

Glioblastoma is the most aggressive and commonest primary malignant brain tumour. Current standard of care includes surgery, radiation, and alkylating agent chemotherapy. Despite multimodal treatment, the survival of glioblastoma patients is dismal. Loss of O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase(MGMT) protein expression due to promoter methylation reduces glioma cell DNA repair activity and resistance to alkylating agents. Thus, in world health organization (WHO) grade 4 diffuse glioma patients treated with an alkylating agent, methylated MGMT promoter is currently being considered a clinically relevant prognostic as well as predictive biomarker. Our aim was to assess the frequency of MGMT promoter methylation in WHO grade 4 diffuse glioma patients and study their prognostic role and clinicopathological correlations. A two-year prospective cohort research was conducted on 89 WHO grade 4 diffuse glioma patients. The clinical and demographic data were retrieved from our hospital information system. MGMT methylation was assessed using methylation specific polymerase chain reaction. Data was analysed using SPSS-24 software. We studied 89 cases of WHO grade 4 diffuse glioma, of which 38. 2% showed methylation of MGMT promoter. There was no significant difference in age, sex, location of tumor and clinical presentation between the methylated and unmethylated groups. A statistically significant association of methylated MGMT promoter was observed with isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) protein expression (p = 0. 050) and alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) loss (p = 0. 003). No significant association was noted with p53 overexpression (p = 0. 492) and Ki-67 index (p = 0. 698). The median overall survival in these patients receiving standard radiotherapy and concomitant temozolomide chemotherapy showed a trend towards better survival in group with methylated MGMT promoter (p < 0. 001). Our study suggests that methylation of MGMT promoter is more frequent in the subset of grade 4 diffuse gliomas that significantly exhibit IDH1 immunopositivity and loss of ATRX expression. Also, patients who receive radiation therapy and simultaneous temozolomide chemotherapy have a considerably better prognosis and treatment outcome, if the promoter region of MGMT is methylated. Alkylating agent ATRX Glioblastoma IDH1 MGMT promoter methylation TP53 temozolomide. Introduction Glioblastoma (WHO grade 4) is the most aggressive and commonest of all primary malignant brain tumors. The annual incidence is ~3–4 per 100,000 population and is associated with poor prognosis 1. Assessment of the primary tumor specimens on histology and evaluation of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) status on immunohistochemistry (IHC) is currently the gold standard method of diagnosis for all WHO grade 4 diffuse gliomas 2. In glioblastoma, the survival of patients is dismal despite aggressive treatment protocol, counting for approximately 15-17 months 3. The treatment protocol currently followed includes surgical resection of primary tumor, followed by radiation therapy, and six cycles of chemotherapy with an alkylating agent like temozolomide (TMZ) 4. The cellular toxicity of alkylating agents is exerted through alkylation of guanine at its O6 position 5. O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT), a DNA repair enzyme, rapidly eliminates these alkyl adducts over guanine, and thus counteracts the cytotoxic effect exerted by alkylating agents by preventing the formation of cross-links 6. This causes resistance to temozolomide 7. Methylation of MGMT promoter region leads to loss of expression of MGMT protein causing a reduction in the DNA repair activity of glioma cells and thus prevents their resistance to temozolomide 8-10. The outcome of glioblastoma patients treated with temozolomide is therefore inversely related to the level of expression of enzyme MGMT. Hypermethylation of MGMT promoter highly regulates the expression of MGMT protein and provokes transcriptional silencing 11. Thus, in WHO grade 4 diffuse glioma patients treated with temozolomide, methylated MGMT promoter is now being considered an important and clinically relevant prognostic as well as predictive biomarker 12,13. Pyrosequencing and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS PCR) are among the two most popular methods, currently in use to evaluate the methylation status of MGMT promoter region. MS PCR is a qualitative technique and utilise both methylation and unmethylation- specific primers. These primers amplify separately fully methylated and unmethylated sequences of MGMT promoter respectively 14. There are a few studies in literature that have identified methylated MGMT promoter as an independent prognostic factor in WHO grade 4 diffuse glioma patients. Hence, evaluation of the methylation status of MGMT promoter region is currently considered mandatory for selection of patients in clinical trials 13,15-17. Aim of our study was to determine the frequency of MGMT promoter methylation in a cohort of WHO grade 4 diffuse glioma patients and correlate the findings with various clinical, pathological and immunohistochemical markers expression, specifically IDH1, tumor protein 53 (TP53), alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX), and Ki-67 proliferation index. We have also tried to provide a brief comparison of the findings in our study with those available in the literature.\n",

            "Content: ABSTRACTObjectivesEvidence on the effectiveness of remdesivir when used in real-life clinical practice is controversial. This study aims to analyse its effectiveness and the factors associated with increased mortality in non-critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who require supplemental low-flow oxygen and received remdesivir. MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted at Ramón y Cajal University Hospital (Madrid, Spain) which included all patients treated with remdesivir in our institution during the second pandemic breakout in Spain, from August to November 2020. Treatment with remdesivir was limited to non-critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring low-flow supplemental oxygen, with a treatment duration of 5 days. ResultsA total of 1757 patients were admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia during the study period, of which 281 non-critically ill patients were treated with remdesivir and included in the analysis. Mortality at 28 days after initiation of treatment was 17. 1%. The median (IQR) time to recovery was 9 days (6–15). 104 (37. 0%) patients had complications during hospitalisation, with renal failure being the most frequent (31 patients; 36. 5%). After adjustment for confounding factors, high-flow oxygen therapy was associated with increased 28-day mortality (HR 2. 77; 95% CI 1. 39 to 5. 53; p=0. 004) and decreased 28-day clinical improvement (HR 0. 54; 95% CI 0. 35 to 0. 85; p=0. 008). A significant difference in survival and clinical improvement was identified between patients treated with high and low-flow oxygen. ConclusionThe 28-day mortality rate in patients treated with remdesivir needing low-flow oxygen therapy was higher than that published in clinical trials. Age and increased oxygen therapy needed after the beginning of treatment were the main risk factors associated with mortality.\n",
